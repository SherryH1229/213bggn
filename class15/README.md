## Get annotation of DESeq Genes

``` r
library("AnnotationDbi")
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'AnnotationDbi'

    ## The following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':
    ## 
    ##     select

``` r
library("org.Hs.eg.db")
```

    ## 

``` r
anno_info_Hs <- AnnotationDbi::select(org.Hs.eg.db, keys=rownames(res), 
                                      columns=c("SYMBOL","ENTREZID","GENENAME"), keytype="ENSEMBL",multiVals="first")
```

    ## 'select()' returned 1:many mapping between keys and columns

``` r
res <- merge(res,anno_info_Hs,by.x = "row.names",by.y = "ENSEMBL")
colnames(res)[8:10] <- c("symbol","entrez","name")
#column_to_rownames(res,"Row.names")

# output DESeq genes to a file named deseq_results.csv
res = res[order(res$pvalue),]
write.csv(res,"deseq_results.csv")
